**The inputs which have to be provided are:**
1. Data to be encoded in QR-code in string.
2. QR code version.


**The response will be *byte array* of QR Code PNG image** 

**If there is any error which occurs while generating QR code, it will be thrown as Exception.** 

**Exceptions to be handled while using this functionality:**
1. QrcodeGenerationException
2. NullPointerException
3. InvalidInputException
4. IOException

**Usage Sample**
  
*Usage:*
 
 ```
@Autowired
QrCodeGenerator<QrVersion> generator;
	
    String name = "N : UserName";
	
	String dob = "D : 17-05-1996";
	
	String address = "A :  Mindtree LTD  "Global village Tech Park Rd, RV Vidyaniketan,RR Nagar,Bengaluru, Karnataka 560098";
	
	String uin = "uin : 927391028372";
	
	String gender = "G : Male";
	
	byte[] fileBytes=FileUtils.readFileToByteArray(new File("ImageFilePath"));
	
	byte [] QrCodeInBytes=generator.generateQrCode(name+"\n"+dob+"\n"+address+"\n"+uin+"\n"+gender+"\n"+"I:"+CryptoUtil.encodeBase64(fileBytes), QrVersion.V30);
	
	String filePath = "File.png";
	
	FileUtils.writeByteArrayToFile(new File(filePath), QrCodeInBytes);
