# OTP Request REST Service


**1. Background**

MOSIP Partner can request an OTP for an individual, which can be used to perform OTP based authentication using OTP Request API for that Individual.

 ***1.1.Target users -***  
MOSIP Partner will request for an OTP on behalf of an Individual


 ***1.2. Key requirements -***   
-	MOSIP Partner can authenticate an Individual using OTP sent to the Individual by OTP Request API
-	MOSIP Partner will capture Individual’s UIN/VID and construct OTP Request
-	Once OTP Request is received, authenticate and authorize Partner
-	Check Individual’s UIN/VID for authenticity and validity
-	Same ID type should be used later in OTP authentication request. For example, if Individual's UIN is used in the OTP request, only the Individual's UIN should be used later in the OTP Authentication request. Similarly, if Individual's VID is used in the OTP request, only the Individual's VID should be used later in the OTP Authentication request. And it should not be like UIN used in the OTP request and VID used in OTP authentication request, or vise versa.
-	Create and send OTP to the Individual via message and/or email

 ***1.3. Key non-functional requirements -***   
-	Logging :
	-	Log each stage of OTP Request processing
	-	Log all the exceptions along with error code and short error message
	-	As a security measure, Individual’s UIN or PI/PA should not be logged
-	Audit :
	-	Audit all transaction details in database during OTP Request processing
	-	Individual’s UIN or PI/PA details should not be audited
	-	Audit any invalid UIN or VID incidents
-	Exception :
	-	Any failure in authentication/authorization of Partner and validation of UIN and VID needs to be handled with appropriate error code and message in KYC’s auth response
	-	Any error in Individual authentication also should be handled with appropriate error code and message in Kyc Auth Response 

**2. Solution**   
OTP Request REST service addresses the above requirement -  

1.	MOSIP Partner to construct a POST request with below details and send to Request URL 
`/idauthentication/v1/otp/` - [Sample Request Body](https://github.com/mosip/documentation/blob/master/docs/ID-Authentication-APIs.md#otp-request-service-public)
2.	Authenticate and Authorize MOSIP Partner.
3.	Validate “reqTime” for incoming OTP Requests for valid format and timestamp < 20mins from current time
4.	Integrate with kernel UIN Validator and VID Validator to check UIN/VID for validity. Validate UIN/VID for authenticity in AuthDB
5.	Create OTP using OTP key in the format using OtpUtil- <product_id>_<uin_ref_id>_<txn_id>_<mua_code>
6.	Retrieve mode of communication with Individual using admin config to send generated OTP
7.	Integrate with Kernel SmsNotifier and EmailNotifier to send the generated OTP to their stored phone/email respectively.
8.	Respond to MOSIP Partner with success Auth response - [Sample Response](https://github.com/mosip/documentation/blob/master/docs/ID-Authentication-APIs.md#success-response-2)

**2.1. Class Diagram**

Below are details on the above classes –
-	***OTPRequestDTO*** – Request object with input request for OTP
-	***OTPResponseDTO*** – Response object with success or failure to generate and send OTP
-	***IDAuthFilter*** – Spring filter to intercept OTP Request and Response in order to authenticate/authorize Partner
-	***OTPController*** – Spring Controller to receive OTP Request
-	***OTPRequestValidator*** – Spring Validator to validate input request object OTPRequestDTO
-	***OTPService*** – Spring Service that interacts with OTPManager and OTPUtil to generate OTP
-	***OTPManager*** – Manager class to integrate with Kernel Generate OTP and Validate OTP Rest APIs
-	***OTPUtil*** – Utility class to generate unique key to be used to generate OTP
-	***IDAuthControllerAdvice*** – Spring Controller Advice used to handle all exceptions and send corresponding error response
-	***IDAuthService*** –Spring Service that validates UIN and VID for its authenticity
-	***NotificationService*** – Sprint Service used to send generated OTP to individual as SMS and/or Email
-	***RestHelper*** – Helper class used to make REST API calls

**3. Proxy Implementations -**   
Below are the proxy implementations used in ID-Authentication:
- ***MISP verification*** - Mocked the verification of MISP by using mocked *License Key*.
- ***Partner verification*** - Mocked the verification of Partner by using mocked *Policy* for the partner which provides the information on whether the OTP request is allowed.
