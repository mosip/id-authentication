# ID Authentication API Test Rig

## Overview

The **ID Authentication API Test Rig** is designed for the execution of module-wise automation API tests for the ID authentication services. This test rig utilizes **Java REST Assured** and **TestNG** frameworks to automate testing of the ID authentication API functionalities. The key focus is to validate the Bio auth, OTP auth, kyc, Auth lock, Auth unlock and related functionalities provided by the ID authentication module.

---

## Test Categories

- **Smoke**: Contains only positive test scenarios for quick verification.
- **Regression**: Includes all test scenarios, covering both positive and negative cases.

---

## Coverage

This test rig covers only **external API endpoints** exposed by the ID authentication module.

---

## Pre-requisites

Before running the automation tests, ensure the following software is installed on the machine:

- **Java 21** ([download here](https://jdk.java.net/))
- **Maven 3.9.6** or higher ([installation guide](https://maven.apache.org/install.html))
- **Lombok** (Refer to [Lombok Project](https://projectlombok.org/))
- **setting.xml** ([download here](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-functional-tests/blob/master/settings.xml))

### For Windows

- **Git Bash 2.18.0** or higher
- Ensure the `settings.xml` file is present in the `.m2` folder.

### For Linux

- The `settings.xml` file should be present in two places:
  - In the regular Maven configuration folder (`/conf`)
  - Under `/usr/local/maven/conf/`

---

## Access Test Automation Code

You can access the test automation code using either of the following methods:

### From Browser

1. Clone or download the repository as a zip file from [GitHub](https://github.com/mosip/id-authentication).
2. Unzip the contents to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal (Linux) or command prompt (Windows) and continue with the following steps.

### From Git Bash

1. Copy the Git repository URL: `https://github.com/mosip/id-authentication`
2. Open **Git Bash** on your local machine.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mosip/id-authentication
   ```
---

## Update the property file
1. Navigate to the Ida.properties file located at:
    id-authentication\api-test\src\main\resources\config\Ida.properties
2. Open the file in your preferred editor
3. Update the client secret values and other required credentials as per your environment

---

## Build Test Automation Code

Once the repository is cloned or downloaded, follow these steps to build and install the test automation code:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd api-test
   ```

2. Build the project using Maven:
   ```sh
   mvn clean install -Dgpg.skip=true -Dmaven.gitcommitid.skip=true
   ```

This will download the required dependencies and prepare the test suite for execution.

---

## Execute Test Automation Suite

You can execute the test automation code using either of the following methods:

### Using Jar

To execute the tests using Jar, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the `target` directory where the JAR file is generated:
   ```sh
   cd target/
   ```

2. Run the automation test suite JAR file:
   ```
   java -jar -Dmodules=auth -Denv.user=api-internal.<env_name> -Denv.endpoint=<base_env> -Denv.testLevel=smokeAndRegression -jar apitest-auth-1.2.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar
   ```
   
# Using Eclipse IDE

To execute the tests using Eclipse IDE, use the following steps:

## 1. **Install Eclipse (Latest Version)**
   - Download and install the latest version of Eclipse IDE from the [Eclipse Downloads](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

## 2. **Import the Maven Project**

   After Eclipse is installed, follow these steps to import the Maven project:

   - Open Eclipse IDE.
   - Go to `File` > `Import`.
   - In the **Import** wizard, select `Maven` > `Existing Maven Projects`, then click **Next**.
   - Browse to the location where the `api-test` folder is saved (either from the cloned Git repository or downloaded zip).
   - Select the folder, and Eclipse will automatically detect the Maven project. Click **Finish** to import the project.

## 3. **Build the Project**

   - Right-click on the project in the **Project Explorer** and select `Maven` > `Update Project`.
   - This will download the required dependencies as defined in the `pom.xml` and ensure everything is correctly set up.

## 4. **Run the Tests**

   To execute the test automation suite, you need to configure the run parameters in Eclipse:

   - Go to `Run` > `Run Configurations`.
   - In the **Run Configurations** window, create a new configuration for your tests:
     - Right-click on **Java Application** and select **New**.
     - In the **Main** tab, select the project by browsing the location where the `api-test` folder is saved, and select the **Main class** as `io.mosip.testrig.apirig.auth.testrunner.MosipTestRunner`.
   - In the **Arguments** tab, add the necessary **VM arguments**:
     - **VM Arguments**:
    
    ```
    -Dmodules=auth -Denv.user=api-internal.<env_name> -Denv.endpoint=<base_env> -Denv.testLevel=smokeAndRegression
    ```

## 5. **Run the Configuration**

   - Once the configuration is set up, click **Run** to execute the test suite.
   - The tests will run, and the results will be shown in the **Console** tab of Eclipse.

   **Note**: You can also run in **Debug Mode** to troubleshoot issues by setting breakpoints in your code and choosing `Debug` instead of `Run`.

## 6. **View Test Results**

   - After the tests are executed, you can view the detailed results in the `api-test\testng-report` directory.
   - The report will have two sections:
       - One section for pre-requisite APIs test cases.
       - Another section for core test cases.

---

## Test Report Column Definitions
This section describes the meaning of each column in the test report:
- **Total (T)**
  The total number of test cases considered in the report.
- **Passed (P)**
  Indicates the number of test cases that executed successfully with the expected results.
- **Failed (F)**
  Indicates the number of test cases that failed due to issues such as output validation mismatches or unexpected errors during execution.
- **Skipped (S)**
  Represents test cases that were not executed due to missing prerequisites or data dependencies.
- **Ignored (I)**
  Represents test cases that were intentionally not executed due to limitations such as unsupported features, incompatibilities, or undeployed services.
- **Known Issues (KI)**
  Indicates test cases that failed but are already acknowledged as known issues for the current release, typically linked with a bug or defect ID.

## Details of Arguments Used

- **env.user**: Replace `<env_name>` with the appropriate environment name (e.g., `dev`, `qa`, etc.).
- **env.endpoint**: The environment where the application under test is deployed. Replace `<base_env>` with the correct base URL for the environment (e.g., `https://api-internal.<env_name>.mosip.net`).
- **env.testLevel**: Set this to `smoke` to run only smoke test cases, or `smokeAndRegression` to run both smoke and regression tests.
- **jar**: Specify the name of the JAR file to execute. The version will change according to the development code version. For example, the current version may look like `apitest-auth-1.2.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.

### Build and Run Info

To run the tests for both **Smoke** and **Regression**:

1. Ensure the correct environment and test level parameters are set.
2. Execute the tests as shown in the command above to validate ID authentication API functionalities.
