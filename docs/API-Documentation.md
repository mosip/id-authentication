# Authentication Service (Public)
This service details authentication methods that can be used by authentication partners to authenticate an individual. Below are various authentication types currently supported by this service:

* OTP based
* Demographic based - Name, Date of Birth, Age, Gender, Address, Full Address
* Biometric based - Fingerprint, Iris and Face

## Users of Authentication service
1. **MISP (MOSIP Infrastructure Service Provider)** - MISP's role is limited to infrastructure provisioning and acting as a gate keeper for all authentication requests sent to this service. The MISP is also responsible for the policy creation on the MOSIP servers so their partners will follow the set policy.
2. **Authentication Partners** - Authentication Partners register themselves with MOSIP, under a MISP. Authentication requests are captured by authentication partners and sent to MOSIP, via MISP.
3. **Partner-API-Key** - Associated against a policy.

## POST /idauthentication/v1/auth/
This request will authenticate an individual, based on provided authentication type(s).
